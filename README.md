This repo contains all the functions, analysis, and data used for conducting PID analysis on the Agnes et al context-switching model of plasticity: https://github.com/ejagnes/flexible_switch_2ISP/.

This work was used as part of an MSc thesis investigating the effects of synaptic plasticity on information-theoretic measures of synergy and redundancy.
